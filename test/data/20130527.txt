[10:09:08] <whym>	 who should I ask about how to transfer donated money to WMF?
[10:11:25] <whym>	 was it a good procedure to ask donate@wikimedia.org?
[10:20:19] <Till_WMDE>	 hi whym yes, this is correct.
[11:08:58] <whym>	 Till_WMDE: thanks Till_WMDE, they I should probably wait for a while more
[11:18:37] <Nemo_bis>	 whym: what sort of transfer?
[11:19:43] <whym>	 we collected fees from participants of a Wikimedia-related conference, and promised to donate surplus to WMF
[11:19:59] <Nemo_bis>	 who is "we"
[11:20:15] <whym>	 we at Wikimedian Society of Tokyo, a user group
[11:20:29] <whym>	 some of the participants would like to get individual confirmations from WMF
[11:20:54] <Nemo_bis>	 oh, nice, I didn't know the user group even existed with a name :=
[11:20:59] <Nemo_bis>	 are you incorporated
[11:21:25] <whym>	 no, it's just a collection of people
[11:21:27] <Nemo_bis>	 technically speaking it will always be a donation by the group/whoever to the WMF, not a transfer of donations
[11:21:34] <Nemo_bis>	 ok, so it's a private account
[11:22:30] <Nemo_bis>	 when WMIT had to transfer donations to WMF it was a nightmare
[11:22:39] <Nemo_bis>	 the WMF told us we could not give them the money
[11:23:27] <whym>	 yes, in our case it would be almost normal donation from an individual, I believe
[11:23:29] <Nemo_bis>	 we had to find another lawyer to prove we could and force them to let us wire them the 160 kâ‚¬ or whatever
[11:23:43] <Nemo_bis>	 yep
[11:23:47] <whym>	 except that some confirmation emails to the participants
[11:23:52] <whym>	 are needed
[11:24:02] <Nemo_bis>	 why isn't a receipt enough
[11:24:18] <Nemo_bis>	 what payment method do you use from japan to WMF?
[11:25:46] <whym>	 we maybe are using international mail order or credit card payment
[11:26:16] <whym>	 if WMF has other recommendations, we will also consider them
[11:28:19] <Nemo_bis>	 what's international mail order?
[11:29:40] <whym>	 I meant international money order
[11:32:47] <Nemo_bis>	 ah
[11:32:53] <Nemo_bis>	 first result on en wiki was "Mail-order bride (redirect from International marriage agency)
[11:33:20] <Nemo_bis>	 bank transfers to WMF in USA are extremely expensive
[11:34:05] <Nemo_bis>	 I don't think they shared what's the fee with their new payment processors, it used to be 2 % with GlobalCollect I think?
[11:35:45] <whym>	 don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised for 2 %
