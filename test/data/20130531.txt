[18:09:26] <marktraceur>	 K4-713: So I'm very close to giving up on the dream of covering much of DonationInterface with unit testing, because it's not really written in a way that lends itself to testing. I think a better bet would be browser tests, i.e. Selenium, because then we can make sure it's all working without having to rewrite big swaths of the codebase.
