[19:49:43] <YuviPanda>	 greetings, moneymakers.
[19:50:27] <YuviPanda>	 our new gerrit bot will be spamming this channel shortly
[19:50:48] <YuviPanda>	 (as per https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/64012/3)
[19:50:53] <awight>	 YuviPanda: awesome, thanks for writing that!
[19:51:12] <YuviPanda>	 that patchset is marktraceur's, but that's going to be abandoned shortly. moment
[19:51:17] <awight>	 Can't wait to ask the new bot rude questions
[19:51:18] <slander_>	 #993: (AW) Description changed -- https://mingle.corp.wikimedia.org/projects/fundraiser_2012/cards/993
[19:52:03] <YuviPanda>	 awight: sadly it doesn't respond yet.
[19:52:19] <awight>	 lolrrit: whence bug? whither comments...
[19:52:20] <YuviPanda>	 I indend on making it respond in a witty way to any message containing 'gerrit sucks'
[19:52:27] <awight>	 eeexcellent
[19:52:49] <YuviPanda>	 it's also all javascript, so go wild if you feel like it
[19:52:49] <awight>	 I'll have to lolcat-encode my daily complaints, in that case
[19:53:21] <awight>	 hehe although PHP makes me a bit more prone to axe-swinging...
[19:53:34] <YuviPanda>	 awight: ^
[19:53:35] <awight>	 when i see .js, i just get relaxed all over ;)
[19:53:56] <YuviPanda>	 https://github.com/yuvipanda/lolrrit-wm/commit/7c3b2345b05882199a493ca4b2e502022c21bc0e is the commit in question
[19:54:15] <YuviPanda>	 awight: let me know if you want more channels added
[19:54:28] <awight>	 this is rad.
[19:55:33] <YuviPanda>	 indeed.
[19:55:37] <YuviPanda>	 awight: let me know if you want more customizations
[19:55:53] <awight>	 Is the redis feed format documented somewhere?
[19:55:58] <YuviPanda>	 it is!
[19:55:59] <YuviPanda>	 moment
[19:56:35] <YuviPanda>	 awight: https://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.6/cmd-stream-events.html
[19:56:38] <awight>	 YuviPanda: fwiw, if you ever need to do similar in python, feel free to cannibalize from slander_: help
[19:56:38] <slander_>	 If I only had a brain: https://github.com/adamwight/slander -- Commands: help config kill last
[19:56:39] <YuviPanda>	 exact same as that
[19:56:54] <YuviPanda>	 awight: the redis feed 'feeder' (the producer side) is in python :)
[19:57:26] <YuviPanda>	 awight: that redis feed is also available toe veryone, so let me know if you want access / have ideas for more tools
[19:57:59] <YuviPanda>	 awight: I wrote it in js simply becaucse my other bot (GitHub PullRequest -> Gerrit sync) is already in python, and I wanted to try something else.
[19:58:03] <awight>	 very good to know of its existence!
[19:58:29] <YuviPanda>	 also if FR wants to use GitHub for any of their repos, let me know and I'll turn it on :)
[19:58:32] <awight>	 YuviPanda: whoa, are you saying our github mirrors are r/w now?
[19:58:37] <YuviPanda>	 awight: yes!
[19:58:47] * awight  chokes on grilled cheese
[19:58:50] <YuviPanda>	 the bot isn't fully stable so I've not announced it more broadly yet.
[19:59:16] <YuviPanda>	 awight: but look at https://github.com/wikimedia/apps-android-commons/pulls?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed
[19:59:25] <YuviPanda>	 we've been using it exclusively for the last month or so now
[19:59:35] <YuviPanda>	 awight: let me know if you want it turned on for any repos :)
[19:59:56] <awight>	 definitely will!  Thanks for taking the time to write that
[20:00:13] <YuviPanda>	 awight: :) yw
[20:00:37] <YuviPanda>	 I'll definitely make that a lot more stable and push for wider acceptance, before wikimania
[20:01:39] <awight>	 YuviPanda: So, I won't announce until you're ready, but I know of at least one other project which was sad about having to pick Github over Gerrit, and this would let them get the best/worst of both...
[20:01:51] <awight>	 I'll keep my ears peeled for yr announcement.
[20:01:55] <YuviPanda>	 awight: oh, I can gladly set them up
[20:02:06] <YuviPanda>	 awight: I announced this on wikitech a month or two ago :P
[20:02:15] <YuviPanda>	 awight: by 'announce' I just meant 'push people until they opt in'
[20:02:28] <awight>	 I see ;)
[20:02:28] <YuviPanda>	 it's fairly stable and can service other projects too, though it's currently built to run on toollabs.
[20:02:33] <YuviPanda>	 but the only hard dependency is redis
[20:02:39] <YuviPanda>	 awight: http://github.com/yuvipanda/SuchaBot
[20:02:42] <YuviPanda>	 which project is this?
[20:02:55] <awight>	 CiviCRM.org, I'm letting them know this moment ;)
[20:03:41] <YuviPanda>	 sure!
[20:03:56] <YuviPanda>	 documentation etc is sparse, but I'll *love* to set it up for them on their infrastructure.
[20:04:57] <awight>	 If you're serious, I'll pass that offer along as well...
[20:05:09] <YuviPanda>	 awight: I am, though not until the weekend
[20:05:26] <YuviPanda>	 I can also pop into their IRC channel of choice to answer questions right now
[20:05:36] <YuviPanda>	 since I'm only multitasking with some light-intensity editing work now
[20:07:58] <YuviPanda>	 awight: can you also test grrrit-wm by doing something in the appropriate repos?
[20:11:42] <awight>	 YuviPanda: cool, I CC'd you in an email to the CiviCRM core team.
[20:11:47] <YuviPanda>	 sweet!
[20:11:53] <awight>	 Yep, prodding repos right now...
[20:12:41] <YuviPanda>	 this is all part of an effort to make sure that I'm not pigeonholed as the 'that android programmer'. Never want to be one dimensional :)

[20:16:28] <awight>	 I think it works ;)
[20:16:32] <YuviPanda>	 :)
[20:16:35] <awight>	 looks good, too
[20:16:39] <YuviPanda>	 yeah\
[20:16:48] <YuviPanda>	 if someone else CRs your patch, it'll ping *both* of you
[20:16:53] <YuviPanda>	 which I think is very useful
[20:16:57] <awight>	 whaat that's great
[20:17:10] <YuviPanda>	 also when someone else updates your patchset
[20:17:19] <awight>	 "Hey check out this bot written by that android guy" ;)
[20:17:20] <YuviPanda>	 of course, it uses gerrit names, not IRC names, but not much I can do about that
