[00:59:09] <mwalker>	 awight: re ^ probably; I just don't know the best way of doing it
[00:59:59] <awight>	 mwalker: It would be mad helpful to people maintaining and cloning banners.  we should ask them
[01:00:28] <awight>	 just not megan ;)  She probably has a steno pad with the docstrings
[01:00:30] <mwalker>	 that and marking messages as 'variables'
[01:00:58] <awight>	 hmm.
[01:01:47] <awight>	 Yes, the vars are a much different beast than simple translation strings.
[01:02:41] <awight>	 we need to do something about the diet variable name, btw
[01:02:47] <awight>	 I think you had a plan for that?
[01:03:02] <awight>	 It should be determined by the banner 'class' or something, right?
[01:03:46] <awight>	 We should write a card for the banner variable auto-combinator...

[16:24:48] <K4-713>	 the-wub: Hey, good morning. Question for you: What are the campaign names for mobile?
[16:25:35] <the-wub>	 morning K4-713. C13_mobile_enUS_FR & C13_mobile_enGB_FR
[16:26:03] <K4-713>	 Cool, thanks. I'm just running some queries over here...
[16:26:11] <K4-713>	 ...super curious how this is going to turn out.
[16:27:23] <the-wub>	 yeah, I'm still seeing hardly any donations
[16:27:52] <K4-713>	 I've got... 8 for the US.
[16:28:05] <the-wub>	 yep
[16:28:14] <the-wub>	 and 1 in the UK
[16:28:17] <K4-713>	 :/
[16:28:48] <K4-713>	 Wait a minute... I have a lot more for the UK.
[16:28:58] <K4-713>	 15, actually.
[16:29:48] <the-wub>	 oh yeah, I was looking at it since I put it back up today. there were about 15 yesterday/this morning
[16:30:02] <K4-713>	 aaaaha.
[16:30:20] <K4-713>	 When did it go back up?
[16:30:46] <the-wub>	 1300 UTC. so 3.5 hours ago
[16:31:20] <K4-713>	 Cool... that matches what I've got here. Take it down in the 1000 hour?
[16:31:34] <K4-713>	 I mean: Did you take it down in the 1000 hour, UTC.
[16:31:45] <the-wub>	 yep, it was around then
[16:31:52] <K4-713>	 Cool.
[16:32:47] <the-wub>	 I suspect there is some problem where banners are hardly showing. If it was a problem with the actual donation process, we would surely have had some emails about it
[16:32:59] <K4-713>	 Hm. Maybe?
[16:33:03] <the-wub>	 but josh reported nothing last time
[16:33:15] <K4-713>	 I mean, I might not go through the trouble of bug-reporting on my phone, either.
[16:33:46] <the-wub>	 yeah perhaps
[16:35:59] <K4-713>	 So, that 8 in the US is possibly interesting, actually.
[16:36:25] <K4-713>	 Half of those were in the last hour..
[16:36:40] <K4-713>	 Which is, granted, still only four.
