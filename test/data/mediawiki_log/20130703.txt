[00:00:14] <K4_the_Beige>	 It usually doesn't let people get away with no expiration date.
[00:00:49] <K4_the_Beige>	 Maybe some strange combination of actions breaks their validation such that you can submit their stuff with no expiration date.
[00:01:51] <jvandavier>	 hmm
[00:04:43] <K4_the_Beige>	 mwalker: ...So, I'm looking at a ton of old, old, old forms.
[00:04:48] <K4_the_Beige>	 And I want them to... go away.
[00:05:15] <K4_the_Beige>	 But, it's big enough I'm wanting to run the disappearing act by you before I actually do it.
[00:05:22] <mwalker>	 ok
[00:05:38] <K4_the_Beige>	 I mean, you're probably going to do the CR anyway. But.
[00:05:42] <mwalker>	 also; why are you beige?
[00:06:12] <K4_the_Beige>	 I did a... wizard thing. But it was a pretty easy wizard thing.
[00:06:44] <K4_the_Beige>	 So it couldn't be an impressive... um, anyway.
[00:07:21] <K4_the_Beige>	 I want to disappear all the form classes that aren't RapidHTML, basically.
[00:07:52] <K4_the_Beige>	 Haven't used any of them, even academically, for well over a year now.
[00:26:41] <mwalker>	 well; you wont get any argument from me
[00:43:45] <marktraceur>	 mwalker: Error, marktraceur requires two arguments (none given)
[00:44:12] <mwalker>	 marktraceur(go, home)?
[00:44:19] <marktraceur>	 I did already!
[00:44:20] <marktraceur>	 God
[00:44:30] <marktraceur>	 Now I need to find food
[00:44:35] <mwalker>	 arhar!
[00:44:36] <marktraceur>	 How am I supposed to do that in the Mission?
[00:44:38] <marktraceur>	 I miss BART
[00:44:51] <mwalker>	 wait... you're complaining that there is no food in the mission!?
[00:45:01] <mwalker>	 that's where all the best food is!
[00:45:04] <marktraceur>	 Sarcastically, but yeah
[00:45:13] <marktraceur>	 I could probably do...I dunno...thai
[00:45:32] <mwalker>	 hehe -- tired of mexican?
[00:45:45] <marktraceur>	 mwalker: You take that back right now
[00:45:49] <marktraceur>	 There's no such thing
[00:46:01] * marktraceur  is still sort of woozy from the bike ride but you get the picture
[00:46:47] <mwalker>	 woh!
[00:46:50] <mwalker>	 you rode your bike!
[00:46:55] <marktraceur>	 Yeah!
[00:46:56] <marktraceur>	 Twice!
[00:46:57] <marktraceur>	 Well
[00:47:04] <marktraceur>	 1.95 times!
[00:47:10] <marktraceur>	 I walked about a block
[00:47:24] <mwalker>	 close enough
[00:47:28] <mwalker>	 *high five*
[00:48:03] <marktraceur>	 Heh.
[00:48:07] <marktraceur>	 I was going to do it tomorrow
[00:48:18] <marktraceur>	 But now I'm thinking I might either die tonight or take Muni again
[00:48:26] <marktraceur>	 And/or a cab
[00:48:26] <marktraceur>	 I'm so tired matt
[00:57:41] <mwalker>	 marktraceur: you can do it!
[00:57:53] <mwalker>	 the more you bike the easier it gets!
[01:13:02] <K4_the_Beige>	 EXTERMINATE: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/71750/
[01:14:05] <K4_the_Beige>	 I, ah, didn't delete all of them.
[01:14:07] <K4_the_Beige>	 Yet.
[01:14:33] <K4_the_Beige>	 Just the easy ones.
[01:23:48] <mwalker>	 marktraceur: also; if you're there and not dead, it would be totally wonderful if you could do a bit of centralnotice cr for me
[01:23:52] <mwalker>	 K4_the_Beige: looking now
[01:25:00] <K4_the_Beige>	 Eh, it's 6:30 (nearly). I started at, like, 7:30 this morning.
[01:25:08] <K4_the_Beige>	 So, I'm going to... stop.
[01:28:16] <K4_the_Beige>	 There do seem to be a ton of css selectors that don't go to anything anymore after all that. So, the next step will be fun too.
[01:31:39] <mwalker>	 hurm
[01:31:41] <mwalker>	 yay?
[01:31:45] <mwalker>	 that was a concern of mine
[01:31:49] <mwalker>	 but I merged it anyways
[01:32:13] <K4_the_Beige>	 No, I mean: cruft in the remaining files.
[01:32:27] <K4_the_Beige>	 Not unstyled form elements. Styles that apply to nothing.
[01:32:57] <K4_the_Beige>	 ...because it's all deleted, and we were apparently really into cloning.
[01:33:31] <K4_the_Beige>	 Also: build failed by zuul-bot for code that hasn't changed in... longtime?
[01:33:35] <K4_the_Beige>	 marktraceur: That you?
[01:39:55] <K4_the_Beige>	 Bah, I'm going for real this time. Happy Blowup Times, everybody! See y'alls on Friday.
[01:40:40] <K4_the_Beige>	 except for mwalker. You tomorrow. :)
[01:59:57] <marktraceur>	 Agh, sorry, ignore Jenkins for DI right now
[17:12:06] <marktraceur>	 Oh, right, everyone's out today
[17:12:09] <marktraceur>	 Well fine
[17:12:22] <mwalker>	 marktraceur: not totally true
[17:12:26] <marktraceur>	 Oh, huh
[17:12:31] <marktraceur>	 Are you in the office?
[17:12:33] <mwalker>	 nooo
[17:12:34] * marktraceur  looks over
[17:12:36] <mwalker>	 that would be silly :)
[17:12:43] <marktraceur>	 Of course not
[17:13:11] <marktraceur>	 I was going to reiterate that the Jenkins jobs are currently failing because they're borked. But I think the solution is for me to make them less-voting
[17:13:22] <mwalker>	 hehe
[17:15:18] <mwalker>	 also of note! can I get you to do some CR in centralnotice for me?
[17:16:53] <marktraceur>	 Ah, yeah, sure
[17:17:04] <marktraceur>	 Just let me merge/deploy this zuul change
[17:17:11] <mwalker>	 :) https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/71751/
[17:17:17] <mwalker>	 *thumbs up*
[17:17:32] <marktraceur>	 bd :)
[17:17:58] <marktraceur>	 (b looks like a right hand with thumb up, d looks like a left hand with thumb up)
[17:18:00] <mwalker>	 when you get zuul happy -- I'll try and resubmit a gerrit patch to DI from yesterday
[17:18:05] <marktraceur>	 *nod*
[17:18:15] <marktraceur>	 "happy" consists of making it not yell at you.
[17:18:16] <mwalker>	 I usually do that as b(^.^)d
[17:18:30] <mwalker>	 hehe -- works for me
[17:18:56] <marktraceur>	 There is no real bugfix, there is only zuul (and hacks in its config)
[17:20:52] <marktraceur>	 mwalker: K, launch yer patch
[17:22:03] * mwalker  makes train noises
[17:23:11] <mwalker>	 you might have broken it...
[17:23:34] <marktraceur>	 I uh
[17:23:36] <marktraceur>	 I doubt that
[17:23:48] <marktraceur>	 Considering that the log is chugging along fine
[17:24:08] <mwalker>	 ah... it's just taking a while to get to things
[17:24:41] <marktraceur>	 Done and done
[17:24:47] * marktraceur  goes back to UWy things
[17:25:19] <mwalker>	 my patch pretty please :)
[17:26:15] <marktraceur>	 OH right.
[17:26:21] * marktraceur  is a forgetful son of a gun
[17:26:31] <marktraceur>	 mwalker: Wow that's a lot of code
[17:26:37] <mwalker>	 most of it's comments
[17:26:52] <mwalker>	 or boiler plate
[17:27:28] <mwalker>	 I really only needed a quick method to get campaign priority -- but moving forward I want a campaign object so this seemed like a not half bad time to introduce it
[17:33:29] <mwalker>	 meganhernandez: ping :)
[17:34:05] <meganhernandez>	 hi mwalker
[17:35:22] <mwalker>	 Brian Sisolak and I seem to have all the details worked out on getting him the new email list -- so I was wondering two things a) when do you want me to pull that list (given the current fundraising) and then b) I recall that we were going to have a chat with the-wub about him doing this but not when...
[17:37:37] <meganhernandez>	 yes can we wait until next week to pull? and let's definitely loop peter in so he learns how
[17:37:44] <meganhernandez>	 meet with peter next week too?
[17:37:51] <meganhernandez>	 or whenever works for you
[17:37:52] <meganhernandez>	 brb
[17:43:20] <the-wub>	 meganhernandez, mwalker: next week works for me
[17:43:31] <mwalker>	 awesome
[17:43:40] <mwalker>	 the-wub: do you have access to aluminium?
[17:43:59] <mwalker>	 (the server, not the material)
[17:44:14] <jvandavier>	 hehe
[17:44:22] <the-wub>	 mwalker: I do
[17:44:54] <meganhernandez>	 back
[17:45:25] <meganhernandez>	 sorry i had to literally run to the street to grab a book at the bus stop from a girl who was still on the bus
[17:45:28] <meganhernandez>	 that was coordinated
[17:45:30] <meganhernandez>	 but back
[17:45:42] <mwalker>	 the-wub: awesome; how about database credentials?
[17:45:56] <mwalker>	 meganhernandez: *applause*
[17:46:05] <the-wub>	 mwalker: yep, got those too
[17:46:05] <mwalker>	 coordinated book grabbing!
[17:46:10] <mwalker>	 the-wub: amazing!
[17:46:16] <mwalker>	 then I'm almost all set
[17:46:31] <mwalker>	 actually -- can you try connecting to the mwalker database?
[17:46:39] <mwalker>	 on db1008
[17:48:26] <mwalker>	 or! do you have your own database?
[17:48:39] <mwalker>	 the script needs a scratch space
[17:50:08] <the-wub>	 I'm connected to mwalker
[17:50:25] <the-wub>	 on fundraisingdb-write.wmnet, not sure if that's the same
[17:50:55] <mwalker>	 oh cool; I didnt realize we had a cname for it
[17:51:27] <mwalker>	 on mwalker can you CREATE TABLE test( id int primary key ); ?
[17:52:44] <the-wub>	 ERROR 1142 (42000): CREATE command denied to user 'pcoombe'@'208.80.154.6' for table 'test'
[17:53:21] <mwalker>	 cool
[17:53:34] <mwalker>	 Jeff_Green: can you give pcoombe write access to mwalker?
[17:53:41] <Jeff_Green>	 sure
[17:56:32] <Jeff_Green>	 done
[17:56:41] <mwalker>	 *high five* you are awesome
[17:58:17] <the-wub>	 it works. thanks Jeff_Green
[17:58:27] <Jeff_Green>	 yw
[17:59:44] <marktraceur>	 mwalker: So I'm happy with the code but I haven't tested it. As a matter of principle, should I before +2ing?
[18:00:31] <mwalker>	 I tested it; but I'm always happy to have another set of test cases unrelated to my own poking at the thing
[18:01:02] <mwalker>	 which probably really means; test it if you already have CN set up
[18:01:09] <marktraceur>	 Noooope
[18:01:32] <marktraceur>	 Alternatively I could +1 and we could yell at someone else to test it
[18:01:58] <mwalker>	 the only other possibly candidate is kaldari
[18:02:15] <mwalker>	 and he's not online
[18:02:36] <mwalker>	 I vote for +2 and if it breaks shit I'll roll it back :)
[18:05:53] <mwalker>	 the-wub: do you have a bugzilla account?
[18:06:01] <mwalker>	 I ask because: https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50663
[18:07:31] <the-wub>	 mwalker: I do - thewub.wiki@googlemail.com. No idea what could be causing that problem though
[18:09:07] <mwalker>	 you might want to follow fr-tech@wikimedia.org -- that seems to be our catchall bugzilla address
[18:09:16] <mwalker>	 but -- as to what's causing it
[18:09:34] <mwalker>	 the only theory I've got right now is that the makeBannerSpace function is not making enough space :)
[18:11:30] <the-wub>	 I'll look into it
[18:13:48] <mwalker>	 kk; I'm guessing he got one of these banners http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralNotice&method=listNoticeDetail&notice=C13_wpdr_mlWW_FR
[18:14:58] <mwalker>	 also; very curious why the preview isn't working
[18:15:00] <mwalker>	 that's annoying
[18:18:55] <the-wub>	 I think it's this one (a non-dropdown) https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralNoticeBanners/Edit/B13_0701_txt_Cntrl_nd_enYY
[18:19:05] <the-wub>	 can't reproduce the problem though
[18:20:35] <mwalker>	 I was thinking it might also be B13_0701_txt_Fsion_ndnc_enYY
[18:24:58] <the-wub>	 nope fairly sure it's the one I posted. he's in Poland (the screenshot shows Polish zlotys), and that banner's assigned there
[18:28:27] <mwalker>	 ah
[18:28:34] <mwalker>	 good catch :)
[18:36:31] <mwalker>	 the-wub: btw -- do you have access to crossbrowsertesting?
[18:36:58] <the-wub>	 no. do we have such a thing?
[18:37:09] <mwalker>	 yes
[18:37:10] <mwalker>	 hang on
[18:37:11] <the-wub>	 if I could have access, that would be wonderful
[18:37:43] <mwalker>	 should be in your inbox
[18:40:25] <mwalker>	 that being said; on winxp sp3 with firefox 21; forcing to poland; I couldn't get a repo either
[18:40:51] <the-wub>	 that site is so cool
[18:41:00] <the-wub>	 but I can't reproduce either
[18:41:31] <mwalker>	 it's crazy useful :)
[18:57:32] <mwalker>	 marktraceur: how goes the fight?
[19:04:00] <marktraceur>	 mwalker: Not great, let me plus2 that for ya
[19:04:51] <mwalker>	 :(
[19:04:59] <mwalker>	 troubles I can help with?
[19:05:51] <marktraceur>	 mwalker: Not particularly, unless you want lunch somewhere near the office
[19:05:57] <marktraceur>	 I am huuuungryyyy
[19:06:27] <mwalker>	 sorry... /me waves his piece of leftover pizza in the air
[19:06:42] <marktraceur>	 Berk.
