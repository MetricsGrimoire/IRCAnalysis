[00:18:29] <K4-713>	 heh. Maybe? I'm sort of in a place of extreme inefficiency right now.
[00:20:19] <K4-713>	 done
[00:22:42] <mwalker>	 thanks :)
[00:58:53] <K4-713>	 mwalker: I think I'm taking off now.

[17:00:36] <DarTar>	 hey

[17:01:01] <mwalker>	 yep; I'll be in this afternoon
[17:01:15] <DarTar>	 I wanted to chat about two things: CN docs + the Mortar data thing
[17:01:34] <mwalker>	 mortar data?
[17:01:45] <DarTar>	 did I copy you on my mail to sack?
[17:01:50] <DarTar>	 on open source recommender systems
[17:01:57] <DarTar>	 s/sack/zack
[17:02:10] <DarTar>	 this spellchecker on mac os is really killing me
[17:02:54] <mwalker>	 oh yes
[17:02:56] <mwalker>	 that thingy
[17:03:41] <mwalker>	 I havent yet gotten through all my email this morning so I dont know if Zack responded; but I'm not sure what a 'recommendations algorithm' company can offer us...
[17:03:50] <mwalker>	 maybe data sanitization
[17:03:53] <mwalker>	 but... *shrugs*
